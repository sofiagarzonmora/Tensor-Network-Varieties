The Poset DOAD Set Computations File contains basic commands using the Binary Trees Package in Sage and converting trees to posets. 
Using posets, the containment exponent for their corresponding tensor network varieties are computed based only on their DOAD Set structure.
At the bottom of the file, the matrices of containment exponents for non-isomoprhic binary trees are computed, for n=4,5,6,7,8,9,10 leaves.
