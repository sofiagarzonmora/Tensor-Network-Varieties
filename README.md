The Poset DOAD Set Computations File contains basic commands using the Binary Trees Package in Sage and converting trees to posets. 
Using posets, the containment exponent for their corresponding tensor network varieties are computed based only on their DOAD Set structure.
At the bottom of the file, the matrices of containment exponents for non-isomorphic binary trees with leaf labellings from right to left are computed, for n=4,5,6,7,8,9,10 leaves.
In order to compute the tensor of exponents, one can choose a given permutation on the n leaves and apply it to the binary trees in n leaves.
For each such permutation one obtains a different matrix of exponents. The case n=4 is computed at the end.
